    "R-squared has additional problems that the adjusted R-squared and predicted R-squared are designed to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem 1:__ Every time you add a predictor to a model, the R-squared increases, even if due to chance alone. It never decreases. Consequently, a model with more terms may appear to have a better fit simply because it has more terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem 2:__ If a model has too many predictors and higher order polynomials, it begins to model the random noise in the data. This condition is known as overfitting the model and it produces misleadingly high R-squared values and a lessened ability to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a linear regression model every additional predictor variable tends to minimize the error of the model. As a result the $R^2$ value will never decreases for any additional number of predictor variables being included in model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Adjusted $R^2$__ takes into account the number of predictor variables included in the regression model. Unlike $R^2$, adjusted $R^2$ can decrease with increase in  number of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_a^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{SSE}{n-k-1}}{\\frac{SST}{n-1}} $$\n",

    "> $ \\sum(y_{i} - \\bar{y})^{2} = \\sum(\\widehat{y_{i}} - \\bar{y})^{2} + \\sum(y_{i} - \\widehat{y_{i}})^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ values, __F-test__ can also be used to suggest that model is significant\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be said that adj $R^2$ has a penalization factor __(n-k-1)__ so as we add more regresssors the adj $R^2$ decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance. The adjusted R-squared can be negative, but itâ€™s usually not.  It is always lower than the R-squared.\n",

We can only compare our modelâ€™s error metrics to those of a competing model. The effect of the square term in the MSE equation is most apparent with the presence of outliers in our data. While each residual in MAE contributes proportionally to the total error, the error grows quadratically in MSE. This ultimately means that outliers in our data will contribute to much higher total error in the MSE than they would the MAE. Similarly, our model will be penalized more for making predictions that differ greatly from the corresponding actual value. This is to say that large differences between actual and predicted are punished more in MSE than in MAE.

    "Just as MAE is the average magnitude of error produced by your model, the MAPE is how far the modelâ€™s predictions are off from their corresponding outputs on average. Like MAE, MAPE also has a clear interpretation since percentages are easier for people to conceptualize. __Both MAPE and MAE are robust to the effects of outliers thanks to the use of absolute value.__\n",

    "However for all of its advantages, we are more limited in using MAPE than we are MAE. Many of MAPEâ€™s weaknesses actually stem from use division operation. Now that we have to scale everything by the actual value, MAPE is undefined for data points where the value is 0. Similarly, the MAPE can grow unexpectedly large if the actual values are exceptionally small themselves. Finally, the MAPE is biased towards predictions that are systematically less than the actual values themselves. That is to say, MAPE will be lower when the prediction is lower than the actual compared to a prediction that is higher by the same amount. The quick calculation below demonstrates this point.\n",
