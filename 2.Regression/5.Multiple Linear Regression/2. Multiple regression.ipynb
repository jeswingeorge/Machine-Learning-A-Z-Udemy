The __coefficients__ describe the mathematical relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. The __p-values__ for the coefficients indicate whether these relationships are statistically significant.\n",

    "#### Interpreting P-Values for Variables in a Regression Model\n",

    "Regression analysis is a form of inferential statistics. __The p-values help determine whether the relationships that you observe in your sample also exist in the larger population.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The __p-value__ for each independent variable tests the __null hypothesis__ that the variable has no correlation with the dependent variable. If there is no correlation, there is no association between the changes in the independent variable and the shifts in the dependent variable. In other words, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is effect at the population level.\n",

    "If the p-value for a variable is less than your significance level, your sample data provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis for the entire population.

This variable is statistically significant and probably a worthwhile addition to your regression model.\n",

    "The regression output example below shows that the South and North predictor variables are statistically significant because their p-values equal 0.000.

A negative coefficient suggests that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable tends to decrease.\n",
