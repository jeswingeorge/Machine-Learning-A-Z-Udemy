    "## 1. Motivation – Why learn Linear Algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    " 4 scenarios to showcase why learning Linear Algebra is important\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Scenario 1\n",
    "![](flw.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you see when you look at the image above? You most likely said flower, leaves -not too difficult. But, if I ask you to write that logic so that a computer can do the same for you – it will be a very difficult task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably know that computers of today are designed to process only 0 and 1. So how can an image such as above with multiple attributes like colour be stored in a computer? This is achieved by storing the pixel intensities in a construct called Matrix. Then, this matrix can be processed to identify colours etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So any operation which you want to perform on this image would likely use Linear Algebra and matrices at the back end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 2\n",
    "If you are somewhat familiar with the Data Science domain, you might have heard about the world “XGBOOST” – an algorithm employed most frequently by winners of Data Science Competitions. It stores the numeric data in the form of Matrix to give predictions. It enables XGBOOST to process data faster and provide more accurate results. Moreover, not just XGBOOST but various other algorithms use Matrices to store and process data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 3:\n",
    "Deep Learning- the new buzz word in town employs Matrices to store inputs such as image or speech or text to give a state-of-the-art solution to these problems. Weights learned by a Neural Network are also stored in Matrices. Below is a graphical representation of weights stored in a Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](wts.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario 4:\n",
    "Another active area of research in Machine Learning is dealing with text and the most common techniques employed are Bag of Words, Term Document Matrix etc. All these techniques in a very similar manner store counts(or something similar) of words in documents and store this frequency count in a Matrix form to perform tasks like Semantic analysis, Language translation, Language generation etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "![](2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if we add an extra variable z then our efforts will be increased tremendously for finding the solution of the problem. Now imagine having 10 variables and 10 equations. Solving 10 equations simultaneously can prove to be tedious and time consuming. Now dive into data science. We have millions of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix is used to solve a large set of linear equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, a linear equation in three variables represents a plane. More technically, a plane is a flat geometric object which extends up to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the case of a line, finding solutions to 3 variables linear equation means we want to find the intersection of those planes. Now can you imagine, in how many ways a set of three planes can intersect? Let me help you out. There are 4 possible cases –\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No intersection at all.\n",
    "2. Planes intersect in a line.\n",
    "3. They can intersect in a plane.\n",
    "4. All the three planes intersect at a point.\n",

The reason is that if there are ‘n’ features, the matrix $X^TX$ comes to be the order $n*n$ and its solution costs time of order $O(n*n*n)$. Generally, normal equation method is applied when a number of features is of the order of 1000 or 10,000. Data sets with a larger number of features are handled with the help another method called Gradient Descent."

    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors prove enormously useful in linear mapping. Let's take an example: suppose you want to change the perspective of a painting. If you scale the x direction to a different value than the y direction (say x -> 3x while y -> 2y), you simulate a change of perspective. This would represent what happens if you look a a scene from close to the ground as opposed to higher in the air. Objects appear distorted and foreshortened. A change in perspective in a painting is really just a vector transformation that performs a linear map. That is, a set of points (the painting) gets transformed by multiplying the x distance by one value and the y value by a different value. You can capture the process of doing this in a matrix, and that matrix represents a vector that's called the eigenvector.   \n",
    "\n",
    "If the mapping isn't linear, we're out of the realm of the eigenvector and into the realm of the tensor. So eigenvectors do well with linear mappings, but not with nonlinear mappings. In the case of nonlinear mappings, the fixed points in the eigenvector matrix would be replaced with functions that can take on many different values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors pop up in the study of the spread of infectious diseases or vibration studies or heat transfer because these are generally linear functions. Diseases tend to spread slowly, heat spreads gradually, and vibrations propagate gradually. Diseases and vibrations and heat patterns also tend to spread by contact, so you don't get oddball discontinuous patterns of disease spread of vibration propagation or heat transfer (typically). This means that heat patterns and vibration propagation and disease spreading can be simulated reasonably well by linear maps from one set of points to another set of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear discontinuous systems like explosions or the orbits of a 3-body system in a gravitational field or a star undergoing gravitational collapse don't lend themselves to simple linear maps. As a result, eigenvectors do not offer a good way of describing those systems. For those kinds of nonlinear systems, you typically need tensors instead of linear maps."
